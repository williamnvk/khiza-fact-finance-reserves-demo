What Is Proof of Reserves (PoR)?
Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a process that proves an exchange or brokerage holds sufficient reserves, or assets, to cover all customer deposits. It provides transparency and assurance to clients. A PoR is specific to bitcoin and cryptocurrency companies, as it involves the publication of wallet addresses that hold bitcoin or other digital assets, which can be identified by any user on the blockchain.

By selecting platforms that operate on a full-reserve, you can mitigate risks and ensure your assets remain secure.


Limitations of Proof of Reserves
While a Proof of Reserves is a great way for users to ensure their funds are safe, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

PoRs only represent a snapshot in time: PoRs are typically done on a periodic basis, such as once a month. While users can verify that their exchange had full reserves, they are only basing this information on the last snapshot in time.
Proof of liabilities relies on user participation: To ensure that an exchange’s published liabilities are accurate, users must verify that their account balances are included. However, not all users can be relied upon to check their balances. Instead of anonymizing user balances in a Merkle tree, an exchange could publish a simple list of all its liabilities. However, this would compromise the privacy of its users, who may not want their balances to be made public.
Proof of liabilities only covers user balances: While a proof of liabilities can show the total amount of deposits owed to customers, an exchange may have additional liabilities not included in the proof, such as debt and outstanding contracts. In most cases, user accounts have seniority over other liabilities held by an exchange. In the event of bankruptcy, the users get paid back their deposits before other debt holders. However, this is not always the case and depends on the particular exchange.


Understanding Reserves
Whenever you deposit money at a bank, the bank stores a portion of your deposits in cash and other stable assets to ensure you can reliably withdraw your money. These assets are known as reserves.

Most banks today operate under a fractional reserve system, meaning that for every dollar deposited, the bank only keeps a small percentage of that dollar as reserves. All money not held as reserves is lent to borrowers or otherwise used to generate profits.

A bank’s reserve ratio is the percentage of reserves held for each dollar deposited. When a bank’s reserve ratio is less than 100%, it holds less money than its depositors have entrusted it with. All banks today use this model, called a fractional reserve. If all of its clients were to withdraw at once, this would result in a bank run and some clients would be unable to withdraw their money.

A full-reserve bank has a reserve ratio of 100% or higher, meaning that for every dollar deposited, they hold at least that much cash as reserves. As a consequence, a full-reserve bank can return all deposits to all of its clients at any time. While River is not officially a bank, we do use this full-reserve model for the bitcoin we custody for our clients.,

Importance of Proof of Reserves in the Cryptocurrency Industry
Proof of Reserves is a crucial transparency mechanism in the cryptocurrency industry. By providing cryptographic proof of their on-chain holdings, these institutions can demonstrate solvency and reassure users that their funds are backed one-to-one by actual reserves. This practice is especially vital in an industry prone to security risks, financial mismanagement, and potential insolvency.

The significance of PoR became increasingly apparent following high-profile exchange collapses, such as the FTX bankruptcy in 2022, where customer funds were misused and insufficient reserves were discovered. Without clear proof of reserves, users risk exposure to fraudulent practices, fractional reserves, or insolvency. By adopting PoR, exchanges can foster greater trust, mitigate counterparty risk, and improve overall market transparency.
