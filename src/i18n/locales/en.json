          "question": "How often is the reserve data updated?",
          "answer": "Updates follow two rules: a heartbeat frequency (e.g., every 10 minutes) that ensures regular updates, and a deviation threshold that triggers a new update only when the reserve balance changes beyond a defined percentage (e.g., ±2%)."

        "collateralizationStatus": {
          "question": "What does the collateralization status mean?",
          "answer": "If the status is over-collateralized, it means the verified reserves exceed the circulating token supply — indicating a safety buffer and room for new issuance. If it's under-collateralized, it means the reserves are not sufficient to fully back the issued tokens — signaling a potential risk and the need for corrective action."

        "tokenTracking": {
          "question": "How does Fact Finance track token issuance?",

However, significant information asymmetries between the token and the off-chain asset it represents still limit its full potential. To unlock greater utility and liquidity, tokenized Real Estate assets must be enriched with verified, up-to-date data that provides a real-time connection to the underlying property.",
      "intro2": "Tokenized properties offer greater accessibility, but blockchain technology lacks intrinsic connections to off-chain data. This creates a gap: while tokens can represent ownership, they do not inherently reflect the current market conditions of the real-world asset they are tied to. Fact Finance bridges this gap by serving as the data layer between tokenized assets and proprietary data sources. For example, a Real Estate company tokenizing a property needs the token to reflect more than just ownership, it must also carry the information of the market value for that asset, transforming the token into a true digital twin.",

      "sectionTitle": "Unlocking liquidity and transparency",
      "intro1": "Latin America's economies heavily rely on the commodities sector, driving global markets for agricultural goods, minerals, and energy. Despite its significance, this sector faces challenges such as operational inefficiencies, high transaction costs, and limited access to financing, particularly for smaller producers.",
      "intro2": "Tokenization provides a powerful solution by digitizing physical commodities, making them tradable and usable as collateral for financing. This unlocks liquidity for producers while enabling them to retain ownership of their assets.",
      "riskReduction": "Reducing risk with verified data for commodity tokenization",
      "risk1": "In lending markets, managing risk exposure is critical for both lenders and borrowers. Collateralized assets must be as transparent as possible to reduce perceived risk. In agriculture, for example, variables such as region, weather, grain type, and other qualitative factors significantly impact the associated risk score. Addressing these information asymmetries is key to unlocking tokenization's potential to expand financing to small producers.",
      "risk2": "Fact Finance bridges this gap by connecting tokenized assets, such as grains or livestock, to trusted data sources directly associated with the underlying commodities. This includes:",

      "eventMonitoring": "Event monitoring for tokenized commodities",
      "event1": "By enriching tokens with real-time data, oracles can track off-chain events that directly affect the value or utility of tokenized assets. For example, an insurance smart contract for agricultural assets can use weather oracles to monitor events such as droughts or floods, automatically triggering payouts when predefined thresholds are met. Similarly, Fact Finance's oracles can flag significant changes, such as adverse weather conditions, that may require lenders to reassess loan terms.",
      "event2": "With this data integration, collateralized tokens become dynamic financial instruments rather than static representations, reducing risk and increasing transparency. This enables lending protocols to offer higher Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, giving producers greater access to financing without sacrificing control over their assets."

      "deviation": "The deviation threshold defines how much the reserve balance must change before a new onchain update is triggered. For instance, with a 5% threshold, the system only publishes a new value if the balance moves by 5% or more since the last update. This avoids unnecessary updates due to minor fluctuations.",

      "collateralization": "Over or under collateralization refers to the difference between the verified reserves and the circulating token supply. A positive gap indicates excess collateral (a safety buffer), while a negative gap signals insufficient reserves and potential undercollateralization risk."
